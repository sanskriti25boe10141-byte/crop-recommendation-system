#  🌱 Crop Recommendation System (Agriculture)

A *Machine Learning–based Crop Recommendation System* that suggests the *best-suitable crop* for cultivation based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions. This project helps farmers, students, and researchers make *smart agricultural decisions* by analyzing soil and climate data.

##⭐ Project Overview

This system takes the following parameters as input:

* *N* – Nitrogen content in soil
* *P* – Phosphorus content
* *K* – Potassium content
* *Temperature*
* *Humidity*
* *pH value of soil*
* *Rainfall level*

Using these features, the model predicts the *most optimal crop* using a trained *Random Forest Classifier*.


## ⭐Why This Project?     

* Helps improve *crop productivity*
* Reduces *crop selection confusion*
* Supports *smart farming & precision agriculture*
* Beginner-friendly ML project
* Perfect for *students, **bioengineering, **CSE*, and agriculture-based applications


##  ⚙️Tech Stack

* *Python*
* *Pandas, NumPy*
* *Scikit-Learn*
* *Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook*
* *Random Forest Classifier*
* Dataset from *Kaggle*


## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains soil nutrient values and environmental conditions with their corresponding recommended crop.

*Source:* Crop Recommendation Dataset (Kaggle)


## 🤖 Model Features

* Trained using *Random Forest Classifier*
* Achieves *90%+ accuracy* (based on dataset)
* Supports multiple crop predictions
* Accepts custom user inputs
* Real-time prediction capability


## 💡 How It Works

1. User inputs soil and environmental values
2. Model analyzes the data
3. Predicts the *best crop* to grow
4. Displays output instantly


## 📥 User Input Example


Nitrogen (N): 90
Phosphorus (P): 42
Potassium (K): 43
Temperature: 25
Humidity: 80
pH: 6.5
Rainfall: 100


*Output:*


Recommended Crop: rice
