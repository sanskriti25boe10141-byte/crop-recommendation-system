# Project Statement – Crop Recommendation System

The aim of this project is to develop a system that recommends the best crop for cultivation based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions. 

In this project, we use different soil parameters such as:
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH value
- Rainfall

These values are given as input to the machine learning model.  
The model then analyzes the data and predicts which crop will grow best in those conditions.

### Objectives of the Project:
1. To help farmers choose the most suitable crop for their land.
2. To increase crop productivity using data-based decisions.
3. To understand how machine learning can be applied in agriculture.
4. To reduce wrong crop selection and improve farming accuracy.

### Expected Outcome:
A crop recommendation system that can suggest the ideal crop based on input soil and weather values. This will make the farming process more efficient and beneficial for farmers.
